# Portfolio
The purpose of this portfolio is to show off some of the skills that I have picked up in the past five years completing my computer science degree.

## How to Run
Each project will have its own folder with instructions on how to run it. They will also have demos on YouTube to see how they work.

## Coursework
Most courses at University of Guelph do not allow coursework to be posted publicly. The work in this portfolio is heavily inspired by my university projects. If a project is directly taken from a course, it will be done with a professor's permission, and it will say so in the README.
